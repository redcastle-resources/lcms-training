    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook teaches how to assess map accuracy of LCMS outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook teaches the specific steps LCMS takes to assess map accuracy, your assessment methods can possibly be much simpler if you have a large training sample, simple or systematic random sample design, and/or a map output that always takes the most confident prediction from the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.0.1: Background\n",
    "\n",
    "* While previous tutorials have provided a good depiction of the model error, for a number of reasons, this is not a statistically valid depiction of the map error. The following are reasons why the model error is not the same as the map error in the case of LCMS' current methods:\n",
    "    * Our sample is not a simple random sample - rather it is a stratified random sample\n",
    "    * For Change, we introduce additional logic that makes the default model output different than the map output\n",
    "* LCMS also lacks sufficient training data to leave a subset out of the actual model calibration\n",
    "    * This means we need to simulate the model error using either a bootstrapping technique or k-fold cross validation\n",
    "* If your particular project has sufficient training data to leave a subset out of the actual model calibration, it is a simple or systematic random sample (not stratified random), and the default model predicted class is the same as your final map class, you can skip this step and use the model errors from the methods used in Module 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.0.2: Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you learn how to assess the map accuracy of LCMS map outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the following Google Cloud services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Google Earth Engine`\n",
    "- `Google Cloud Storage`\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding the difference between model and map accuracy\n",
    "- Simulating map accuracy with k-fold cross validation"

    "* If you would like to create your own outputs, specify a different path for `export_path_root`, but leave the `pre_baked_path_root` as it was. This way, the pre-baked outputs can be shown at the end, instead of waiting for all exports to finish.\n",
